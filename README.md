# About
Monero mining pool in Azure Container Instance container pool using a custom compiled container of XMRig with donations removed

## Disclaimer
This is just an example project for academic purposes.  Mining XMR using ACI is by no means profitable.  Although it's perfectly legal to mine XMR, Azure may frown upon such activity and may suspend your subscription

## Further Info 
XMRIG performs best with direct access to the hardware using RandomX CPU optimizations.  XMRIG in any Docker or VM engine will provide less than optimal hashrates.  Again, this was more of a project to do just to see if I could do it.  There is zero real-world feasibility to this project.
